Thank you for visiting my site! ðŸŽ‰

More than one year ago I was looking for a blogging platform but couldn't find it:
One that would let me write posts in markdown with my own editor,
one that didn't look awful buy modern design standards, and one that felt snappy on a mobile phone.
That and more is now this website. I hope you enjoy it [as much as I do].

## First Steps
Start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading.flip-title}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:

* [Install]{:.heading.flip-title} --- How to install and run ....
* [Config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Then you can start with this article
{:.related-posts.faded}

After you've familiarized yourself with my website.
