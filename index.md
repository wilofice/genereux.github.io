Thank you for visiting my site! ðŸŽ‰

More than one year ago I was looking for a blogging platform but couldn't find it:
One that would let me write posts in markdown with my own editor,
one that didn't look awful buy modern design standards, and one that felt snappy on a mobile phone.
That and more is now this website. I share a lot of my passions and my projects here.
